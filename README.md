## ⚠️ Important Notes

- ** PDF uploading:**  
  Uploaded PDF files will be saved in the uploads folder in your local directory.
- ** Outputs:**  
Outputs generated from processed PDF files are saved in the outputs folder. Ensure this folder exists and has write permissions.
- ** CORS error:**  
If you encounter an error in the browser like this:
  ```
  Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/upload' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy
  ```

  You can solve erorr  adding this `allow_origins=["*"]`  to `api/main.py`  

  ```python
  from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

  app.add_middleware(
      CORSMiddleware,
      allow_origins=["*"],  # Tüm domainlere izin verir
      allow_credentials=True,
      allow_methods=["*"],
      allow_headers=["*"],
  )
  ```

## 📌 Add.

- **Frontend and API Communication:**  
The frontend interacts with the API to upload and process PDF files. Ensure both are running simultaneously.
- **Development:**  
 ....


- **Models**
